> Welcome to my portfolio!

This repository contains a collection of interactive projects to showcase my skills in:

- Data Science
- Mathematics
- Statistics
- CS Theory
- Machine Learning
- Software Development

## Usage

Visit the [portfolio site](#coming-soon) hosted on GitHub Pages!

Or, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser to explore the projects locally.

Use the mouse or `arrow keys` + `Enter` to expand and view projects, or subprojects.

Each project includes a set of icon links for quick actions, such as:

- Copying a `git clone` command
- Launching a Jupyter notebook (via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/))

You may also see dev icons showing which software tools or languages were used to build the project.
